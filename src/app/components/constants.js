export const testText = `Is Karin okay with that? Well, Karin is okay with that. Karin never said that she was not okay. It was just that I had my existing startup that I'm working on, right?

Right. Why can't we just make everything fit with that? Fit with that hackathon thing, right? And then put your existing startup on pause for a minute.

You know? With your partners. We have partners, right? And I have other co-founders who I have to be held accountable to.

But you're not in a crazy, intense master's program right now. That's true. That's true. That's what we're reading tonight.

And he's in San Francisco doing a full-time job. But still, I'm like, I'm buying. Well, the original idea for the alignment, and now I'm just realizing how much crazier this whole thing is, was that I was telling myself, I have these two different directions, right? On one hand, there's a science thing that I'm doing with all these science teachers and trying to improve the way that science lab works.

On the other hand, I'm trying to figure out this hackathon thing and help people find meaning in what they're doing. And so I was like, we have a new batch of interns for my startup. Can I not use my hackathon curriculum and apply to mentor them and grow them through my hackathon process and use that as an application, right? And that was the angle that I'm looking at.

But then I realized that, yes, while I can still do that, I still have to manage the overhead of the general science learning component, right? And if we aren't talking to the science teachers and if we aren't doing that kind of user experience right, I'm basically running these people to a dead end. And more importantly is that normally, the way that we recruit for Quest2Learn or I kept my project running is because we have these huge grants, but they're one-off and they don't really do much. And so the way that we sustain our manpower is that kind of like each year we sort of have a batch of new interns who come in and work for us for academic credit.

And the way that we recruit is usually we just say, hey, if you're interested in working at Quest2Learn, join us. And then we'll slowly start to see people trickling off. And usually, well, what I've seen or experienced at least in the past kind of two semesters or quarters was that there's usually around five or six people that actually show up. And I'm like, okay, I can meet with those five or six people.

And then on Tuesday, 12 people showed up. Right. And I'm like, whoa, wait, hang on, 12 people. But I was like, shoot, I already said that we are open door policy.

And like if you're able to show up at work and more importantly, like these kids, they were like actually got skills. And they want to work and they want to work for free, right? And they've got actual skills. And so you want to keep them, right?

But then at the same time, I'm like, I just met with one for half an hour. I'm like, each of them are probably going to at least take me like one hour. Like even if I set up some systems to have like some other people manage them, do I really trust the other people that manage them? And I have to still be the underlying cash flow.

These are growing days. You're not a tiny little startup anymore. You have that much. Exactly.

And so I'm seriously contemplating. I'm like, can we really manage to keep so many people? But then at the same time, I feel so bad because I'm like, she said that we were having an open door policy. But I think you can say, can we put you on hold for six months or four months or whatever, right?

Like you can stagger. It can still be open door policy, but a staggered start. Yeah. Just take five at a time like you're used to.

Staggered start. Yeah, yeah. Staggered start. That's like gold.

Okay. Yeah. Because the fact that I have to manage all of them at the same time. That's like a job in and of itself.

No. And I have this crazy master's program. And I have all the hackathon things that I'm trying to do. And this is not to mention that I have a life.

I think the hackathon thing, if there's any way you can delay it, I think it would just help you. Because that's a lot of work. Or it's going to default to a typical hackathon, which is not a bad thing. But where everything just happens right there with not pre-work and not post-work.

And you could just copy a template of the millions of hackathons that are out there. Or that I've run in the past. Yeah. Yeah.

That's what I'm feeling as well. Just try not to make it something that's painful. But I'm going to try to make sure that it's more in line with my capstone. Because the other thing is that the reason why I have to do the hackathon thing now, because my dad's retiring.

Okay. And he's a professor in Hong Kong local university teaching startup and entrepreneurship. Okay. And I was like, there's no more better opportunity.

I was like, wait dad, you're retiring? If I don't do this now, it's going to be so much harder to do it, right? Because that's your site where you put it all. Exactly.

Even when you're retired though, he still has the connections. The connections don't go away. That's true. But then it would be harder.

I mean, yes and no. It just depends. You're paying a lot of money to do this master's program. That's true.

To do this master's program that you want to be able to delve into the meanings and take your capstone project seriously and give things the time that they deserve. It doesn't mean just being a mom. Yes. No, no, no.

Please be my mom. Literally. I was like, I had a, well, on a personal note side of things. I had a partner for four years when I was at Johns Hopkins who was my mom.

And then we kind of separated since coming to Stanford. So I've been literally, because she was like, China, that's too much. You need to do this. You need to do that.

Slow it down. And then now I don't have that anymore and I'm just literally running myself to death. Yeah. I mean, I saw it last quarter.

I saw it last quarter. I mean, it's hard for you. Today you came to class almost on time. But last quarter you came to class late a lot.

And I know it's not, you're not doing these things on purpose. It's just like the way your life is just so busy. I know. Like, I don't know.

I just, yeah. I don't even know how to, like, yeah. Anyways. I don't know.

Talk with Karin or talk with, or do some hard talks with your founder partners. I think you have to decide like how you want to play the rest of this quarter, next quarter, quarter after. It's going to go by in a second. That's what I feel like too.

And you want to get the most you can while you're here. And I know a lot of LBTers like work full time and try to, like Christine or whatever, you know, like, you're all just like, but then you don't get to do the kind of work that you want to do here. I know. You delve into the readings.

I know. That's why I want to do a PhD, honestly. I take it. And then now, because I'm like, if I get a PhD, I can, like, use that.

And I'm like, I'm doing a PhD, guys. Like, I'm going to shove everything away and just, like, carve out time for a PhD. That's what I'm trying to apply. But then, like, I don't know.

Fingers crossed. We'll see how that turns out. So did you get your application in? I did get my application in.

But then, like, during, like, the day of, Victoria's like, you know you need three years of teaching experience for a CTE, right? For a CTE, yeah. And I'm like, you're telling them. Yeah.

I didn't realize that that was, like, a self-requirement. So I'm not very optimistic. But I'm hoping that, like. Did you apply anywhere else?

Not for PhD. Not for, like, I mean, like, last quarter I was like. I know. I know.

Here is the only place that I want to stay. And, like, here is probably the only place that I even think that I actually have time or would, like, spend the effort to actually do it. And so I wrote my application for here. But that's it.

But I'm thinking that, like, you know, if this thing doesn't work out, then, like, for next year, then I'll be able to kind of propose more. Yeah. And there's some other, you know. I just saw.

Did you probably read it too? Open AI just partnered with Arizona University. Oh, really? Uh-huh.

I don't know what they're doing. But they just partnered. And going on. I mean, there's places I could totally see you if this is not.

I don't really like. See, I like Stanford's weather and the environment. I like Pittsburgh. Well, Arizona has nice weather too.

It gets a little hot in the summer, but yeah. Let me write that down. I don't know anything about the Arizona thing. I just literally read it in the New York Times.

Or actually, I shouldn't even say that. Victoria sent it to me. Victoria sent it to me. Any leads is a good lead.

Like literally, you now know as much as I know. Any lead is a good lead. I mean, I have this backup masters at Hopkins that I'm probably going to default on. Okay.

Hopkins is really impressive. Yeah, I mean, because I did my undergrad there. Okay. And if I go back, there might be another way for me to take a breather.

And also be more aligned with my running the science lab stuff. Yeah. So that's my default. And so I might basically, yeah, I don't know.

But then at the same time, I'm like, I'm also really struggling because I was like, I come all the way out here to Silicon Valley only to come back to Baltimore. You know, am I going to just do that? What am I doing? No, it's hard.

I mean, it's hard. There's also the Career Center, which I find really useful. You know, you are eligible for all of their resources. And they can help you kind of plan backwards and then figure out what does that mean then for each quarter.

So it's edcareers.stanford.edu. Yeah. But I just know that it's kind of fun, and I don't want you to get to August and be like, oh, my God. What the heck did I do?

Yeah. Yeah, that's what I already feel like with the last quarter. I was like, I had a lot of fun in AGI house. And then like, what the heck did I actually do at Stanford?

I'm like, I loved Denise's pope class, like going to the museums. Honestly, going to the museum and just like sitting there and doing that observation was like. We did. I did.

I very much enjoyed it. And I really loved like Emily and like. But then even like last quarter with some of my classes was just like crazy. It's like I had to get game intense game design class, which was very rewarding.

But then like my dad came in and he was like, we're paying $30,000 for you to sit around and play board games. Like, what are you doing? I'm like, I'm learning, Dad. No, no, that's funny.

That's funny. But I think how many classes you take at a time and what, you know, not all classes are created equal in terms of time. Like this is, this is a big time sink. That's why I was like, you're not going to bail on me, right?

Yeah. Yeah. She could be your mom. Yeah.

I know. Maybe I'll see if Kogi would be my mom actually. And then I can honestly at this point I'm just looking for a mom. What I realized was like looking back, I was like, huh.

Yeah. Growing up, I had a great mom. When I was in the UK, I literally, I was like struggling so hard that my mom had to fly over. And then when I went to U.S., when I went to undergrad, I was like, did I really became independent or did I just cry at my mom?

Yeah. And Victoria too says that she's looking out for you. So you've got a lot of us looking out for you. Between Karen and Victoria and me and Kogi, you know.

But anyway, I know that's probably not what you want to talk about. So what do you want to talk about today? Well, just figuring out this like the two, so the hackathon thing I think I generally talk to you about. You know, what was interesting when we were talking about Dewey and just thinking about it was that like it all seems so intuitive to me.

And I feel like what I'm doing with my hackathon thing is putting Dewey into practice. I think that's probably true. It's very aligned. There's a lot of sort of problem-closing, problem-solving curricula out there that allow for free student choice.

Oh, you know what you should look into? The Latin American Leadership Academy. It's called LALA. Latin American Leadership Academy.

That was designed in my class. It's very much what I would think of sort of like your hackathon. They take local Latin American high school students and they allow them to pick a serious problem that is connected to like a city where they live. And they give them all sorts of resources to help sort of solve that problem using a design, you know, method.

Oh, wow. It's not the technology. So it's not at all. But if you talk to those guys and those guys are great, they might be like, hey, do you want to just design technology for us?

Well, I mean, even with actually, I mean, with the hackathon thing, I'm trying to move away from technology. It's where I come. It's like how I'm informed of the space and how I've been introduced to the idea of hackathons. But the reality is like my fundamental belief is like it's all about the problem founder of the day.

It's not about a technology. And I had to learn this. Exactly. And I had to learn this the hard way because, you know, when I was working on my science app, initially we were so married to the idea of we're going to be augmented reality.

And we had the camera thing. And it took us three years to realize that the camera would not help anybody. And it was just causing us problems. Like what's the value?

And so when we now we've completely moved off camera. I'm like, wow. That's a big, that's, I mean, that's real life. And now that I've realized that, I'm like, hackathon.

Pause on the technology. Let's focus on the real need finding. So maybe you need a different name. I think we need a different name.

And so there's all sorts of ones out there. There's another one called Yell. Youth engaged in living and learning or something. Or they design.

Again, it's like you come to us. What are the most important problems that you want to solve? And here's a path for doing it. That's why we call, I tell people it's a hackathon.

It's the way that I inform and frame that idea of like a short design sprint. But what I'm calling it is calling it the Why You Program. Yeah, yeah, that's cute. And so here's, I'll give you a bunch of ones to look into that are very similar.

That would be very good. There's one called Project Wayfinder. W-A-Y-F-I-N-D-E-R. And do you know Misaki?

Is he the Japanese guy who was in L-E-T last year? Yeah, from last year. I know of him. He did a project.

God, I hope I'm not confusing him with another Japanese name I had. I think it's Misaki. Do you know the Japanese concept of ikigai? Ikigai?

If there's a circle of what you're good at, what the world needs, and I think it's like how you can make money or something. I'm not positive what that circle is. But he did a program for Japanese undergrads around finding your purpose and helping you think about sort of why you're, you know, kind of what you're doing and why, which could be kind of interesting for you to look at too. But then I want you to look at the YELL curriculum.

It might be now called YES, Y-E-S. It's either Y-E-L-L curriculum or Y-E-S curriculum, which is where they're finding their own problems. And then certainly the Latin American Leadership Academy, because that is literally, it was designed in my class, parts of it, and that is what they ask them to do. And they do amazing things, right?

I mean, you can see how students do amazing things. Yeah. So that could be good. That could be exciting.

Yeah. I like Y-U. That's cute. It's cute.

You realize why I picked that as well, right? I get it, yeah. Yeah, I get it. I get it.

It's good. It's also a play on Y-C. Yeah, yeah. I get it.

I get it. It's good. It's good. There's so many things you can do, but it doesn't have to happen right this second.

That's true. Like, that can wait. You don't need the students. You have lots of ways of getting students.

That's so true. You don't need your dad, much as I'm sure he would love to help you. So you don't have to do that right now. That's true.

You can take the time to design the project that you want to do instead of being run around totally busy. Yeah, I mean, because that already, like, well, the thing is that I've already committed my spring break to that, so. Can you get out of it? My parents bought the tickets already.

Oh. Yeah, but I think now that I'm informed of that context, though, like, I think it's going to be, like, try and, like, sort it out maybe, like, last week or during spring break and try not to think about it. Well, you can do just that. I mean, I don't mean to belittle this in any way, but, like, design thinking and just follow it.

They've got a million people who will do need finding, you know, empathy, graphic prototype. I mean, it's nothing, it's not anything super new and exciting, but for those kids. It might be new and exciting. Yeah.

That's true. So you don't have to recreate the wheel. I hate the recreating of the wheel. Right?

That is true. And I have a whole, like, YouTube video. Yeah, there you go. See?

See? You can make it very doable for yourself. Yes. The way that you look at it as sort of you're collecting data, you're gaining, you're looking at what's hard for kids, where they stumble, where the challenges are during that process, but you don't have to reinvent the whole design thinking curriculum.

That's true. I mean, I have a curriculum. It's just how do I find other people to teach my curriculum is the part that I'm. Well, I would say before you do that, how do you know it's a good curriculum?

That's why I'm taking your class. Let's not have a relationship until we can assess the quality of it, which you will get, you know, more and more skills every day in my class to learn how to do. Yes. But then empirically I think that it's worked out really well because basically it's my magic sauce of winning 7 out of 13 hackathons.

Yeah. And also, like. I like that. It's, like, stems from my experiences, and, like, I just practiced it this past Saturday with one of the LGBT people, and they were like, wow, China, like, this is game changer.

You should just do this with everybody. And, in fact, I'm planning to do it with Kongyi and everybody as well. It's just, like, walk them through. Because it's, like, it's not just about, like, hackathon or, like, whatever, and casual need finding.

It's about, like, how do you get a group of people who don't know each other together to, like, rapidly know what they're, like, good at? Because the first exercise is literally it's, like, all activity-based. Right. The second exercise is, like, to ask four questions.

What are past projects that you've done? What are skills associated with these past projects? What are skills that you're learning? And what are skills that you want to practice over the course of this project?

That's lovely. And so I call this, like, the edge analysis, and this is, like, my innovative component to the whole, like, d.school thinking because I feel like the way that I've been taught, like, d.school thinking is, like, you just immediately jump into understanding, like, what the problem is and understanding the need. But without being informed of that internal context, right? I think what we're talking about with Dewey today is that balance between, like, the external world and the internal world.

Right. Without being informed about your internal context and your internal world, how would you even go about doing the external world? Right. Which a lot of people are like, I don't know.

There's so many problems. You know, I can't even begin to choose. Exactly, and that's why we then move on to that's why first of all we do this context, and then we then move on to this second phase, which is called discovering your problem. Yeah.

And in this, I leverage the d.school's life design curriculum. Yeah. Where they have the four main buckets of work, relationship, health, and play. Yeah.

So work includes, like, stuff like career or stuff like academics. Oh, no, I know this. Yeah, I know this stuff. Anyways, the idea is that we would do, you know, ten minutes of brainstorming of your personal experiences with all of these things.

Right. The idea is that you would look into, like, for example, like, work, be like, oh, I don't have enough time to finish my assignments. But the idea here is to encourage students to be more specific about the way that they have this problem. So rather than be like, I don't have enough time, I'm like, I forgot to finish my assignment, like, last night.

I spent up to, like, 1 a.m. doing this writing because of a frenzy. And the idea is that, you know, all of these exercises, by the way, are done in think-pair-share methods, where essentially they would work independently for, like, two, three minutes, and then we would then discuss as a group. Good.

And the idea is then to kind of figure out what are your personal problems across different areas in your life, and collectively come together to understand which problem that you guys are most interested in solving over this gamified container of 72 hours. Right. The idea is, like, you're not going to figure out your life right now, but we're going to just practice, you know. Like, getting practice makes perfect.

Right. And so then that's the... So that's why I said it doesn't matter what curriculum you work on because it's the same concept. Exactly.

But then, like, you know, this is, like, kind of, like, stage two, and then we then move into, like, kind of, like, more about the d.school need finding... Right. ...a framework called the code of understanding. And the idea there is that you start off with understanding how the problem is associated with you by doing root cause analysis of asking the five whys.

Right. And then you do a stakeholder map for another five minutes where you then immediately think about, okay, given this problem, who else could be involved? Good. That's the understanding of how this problem is related to you.

Then you think about how this problem is related to people around you. And that's when, once you've created your stakeholder map, then you come up with the questions and then you do your questionnaires, right? And then usually, also, when you're picking the problem, what I encourage students to do or the people who work with me is to pick a student-centric problem... Right.

...because immediately you can then interview other students who are in the same hackathon space. Oh, yeah, totally. And then, so that's understanding how other people immediately around you have this problem. And the idea is that then you would synthesize this through, like, cluster mapping, user persona, journey mapping.

And then once you kind of complete these activities and exercises, then you kick into the third stage, which is understanding how is this problem relevant to the wider society. Right. And the way that you kind of understand that is basically by doing your secondary research. That's when you look at your competitive analysis, what are other people's potential solutions, right?

Or you can also look at, like, are there any literature or research papers out there about the problem space that you're looking at? And then once you understand this, then you then kick your gear into creating a solution, but more importantly, a story around the solution. And so we give students a very limited time window of 12 hours. What is the way that you can create a minimal viable prototype?

And because coming in from a hackathon or coming in from a computer science background, my tendency is to come up with, like, CS-based concepts. But the idea is that students should be allowed or enabled to kind of create any and all kind of solution or concept or whatever paper prototype that they come up with. But the more critical part that I've kind of realized in this whole component is how do you create a story around your solution? And if you kind of follow this process well, ideally the way that you can tell your story is by inverting your cone of understanding.

So we've already done basically the groundwork. In the story, the video, the way that I present in hackathons is I start off with, hey, I have this problem. Hey, I realize that the people around me have this problem. Society also has this problem and they care.

This is why we came up with the solution. And please continue to fund us and support us. Yeah, it's good. And then so then this is then, like, creating the story and the solution and then finally evaluating it is when then you then think about, like, what are the metrics to measure that?

And also, like, kind of presenting it to judges and seeing what other people's feedback is. And so what I kind of realized when I took a step back from attending a lot of hackathons and doing my own startup was that this is essentially the process that I go through. And as a result of going through this process, the end product of my videos, I often just win the hackathons. And I was like, isn't this creating amazing value for society, which is why I want to, like, kind of dedicate my next 10 years to kind of, like, spreading this.

But then at the same time, I feel like in order for people to really believe me or, like, buy into my curriculum, I have to have credibility, right? They were like, if you're so successful as you claim that you are, like, what evidence do you have to show, right? That's why I feel like my science lab thing has to work out, right? Like, I can't just, like, let it sit and die.

And so for me, that internal struggle is, like, I want to, like, freaking sell this or pass this on to somebody else so that I don't have to care about this, so that I can work on this thing that I think is so much more important because it's helping other people find their why and being so much more, like, you know, impactful. But at the same time, I just can't find somebody else to take over what I'm already working on. And so that's my personal struggle. Then you have obligations to your partners.

Where I have obligations to my partner because I feel like I'm the one who's basically holding up the whole show at this point. Well, maybe one of these 12 kids is going to want to be the next you. Yeah, that's what I'm hoping. We found somebody to replace our tech lead, and now I'm looking at that and I'm like, wow, if we found a tech lead replacement, can I find a me replacement?

Yeah. And so I'm really scouting. Yeah, I mean, you need someone as well-spoken as you, as passionate as you, which is hard. I know, and that's what I found.

It's like, it's very easy. But a good entrepreneur is a good storyteller, and you know that. That is so true. But I also want to make sure that people understand how to judge the quality of the thing itself, right?

Like, it's one thing to be able to tell great stories. It's another thing to say, this process leads to really high-quality, effective results, and here's the assessment behind it. Yes. And I think you'll learn some of that in this class, too.

Yes, and I'm hoping to learn that, because then the idea is that we can potentially assess. But the long-term vision for me personally is what, in terms of this topic, I'll just tell you, is to run this pilot in Hong Kong China University, where my dad is at, and then kind of try and replicate this model all across Southeast Asia. Because I think that, you know, really the entrepreneurial spirit there isn't as strong here as what I've seen here in the Bay Area or just even in the East Coast. And kind of run this hackathon process and actually discover something new.

Because right now, what I've realized in the States is that with Major League Hacking, which is the one that organized all the hackathons, all they care about is how I turn computer scientists into computer engineers and find them a job, right? And so they really think about the technology, but they don't really see the value in what people are creating. And so I think that there's a very big blue ocean market here in the sense that I'm hoping to partner up with companies like incubators like Y Combinator and like, you know, other, you know, like Techstars, for example, and essentially go around and then be kind of like a scouting or screening program that would serve as a feeder into that kind of entrepreneurial effort. Because I think that in order for you to be successful, you also have to have sustained support.

For me, I've been to like 13 hackathons, and like all of them are awesome projects. They could potentially go the next step, but because there isn't that community or that support, I'm just kind of like left dry on a vine, right? And so like with what I'm trying to build, the other innovative part is also thinking about a sustainable way to kind of feed them into that kind of feeder program. And eventually potentially starting my own incubator and VC.

But then the idea also here is to really focus on hyperlocalized, you know, problems that are unique to the individual and the individual's community where they're based out of. Yeah, that's good. I like it. That's the vision.

That's the dream. Go follow that vision. So then the question would be, and they'll tell you this at the incubator office, what are the things you need to do here and now that will help prepare you for that vision that you couldn't do anywhere else but Stanford? That's what you have to prioritize.

What do you think? I think definitely taking your class. I think taking my class is going to help for sure. I think picking other classes as carefully, right?

So I'm taking learning core mechanics of learning. Okay, who's teaching that? Kristen, who wrote ABC of learning with Dan. Oh, with Dan.

Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Seminar and learn making crafting for product-based learning with Victor Lee. Well, that's good.

Definitely Victor. All right. Okay. So those are the four other classes.

I mean, originally, well, I'm currently still technically enrolled in interactive embodied learning with Nick Haber. But it's really like computer science. Yeah. And I'm like, no, no.

Okay. Yeah. Let's just take it off the plate. Thank you.

Thank you. Okay. Yes. I'll be your mom.

Yes. No. Okay. I'll take it off the plate.

Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So I think, yeah.

So those are the four main classes that I'm doing right now. And then, I mean, like, maybe I just talk to my startup partner and just be like, hey, I don't think that I have the capacity right now. Yeah. What makes sense?

When can I make it up to you in a different way? You know, here's why I'm here. I'll bring these kinds of things to the partnership when I get out. Yeah.

Yeah. Something like that. Okay. I hope he's able to be more understandable.

Because I'm, like, my worst fear is like, shit, I'm running a full-time job. Let's just call it quits. I know. I know.

And then at that point, I'll be like, man, what am I going to do now? Well, and this is another way to get the Capstone project to fully align with that project that you're doing with him. That's true. Right?

To be efficient. If it's okay with Karin. Yeah. I think it's okay with Karin, because it's, after all, it's about, like, science learning, right?

Yeah, but, you know, it's hard, but I think that at the same time, I'm, like, through these conversations, also figuring that out, because my idea when I applied to Stanford out of a master's is, like, I see all these paths ahead of me, like PhD, entrepreneurship. You're not closing any doors to any of those right now. I just want to kind of navigate and figure it out at Stanford. And I thought that I'd come here, and I'd talk to people, and people would be like, yeah, this is what you should do.

But then I realized that now that I've come here, like, no. Like, I actually have to put in a lot more work, and every decision comes with an opportunity cost. I think that that was the biggest thing that I learned last quarter when I decided to actually finish my application for my PhD, because I was, like, literally sleeping at, like, post-midnight, like, on a daily basis on that week. Because I read your reflection paper for my class, which I know you did, like, totally at the last minute.

And I know it's not you, and that's okay. You made a choice, because you were taking the class credit. No credit. And you passed.

Right? But it's like... And that was totally fine. And that was a survival decision.

But what I'm saying is, where do you want to put that time and effort, and where do you want to do some of those survival decisions or whatever? I agree. Right? I agree.

Yeah. I think you're going to be good. You just have to take some things off the plate. Okay.

So you... What do you need from me? Do you need a letter from me? That was the idea, but I think I can get that from Kristen and Harry.

Yeah. Because I'm not... We're not, you know... Yeah.

I'm not as useful. Harry and Kristen will be, for sure. So they... I also spoke to them, and they kind of said yes.

So if they actually write a letter... I think with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, if they just have a letter from Stanford, that's enough to guarantee the grant. I'm sure Harry said that, because he's impressive. So I'm trying to get Kristen and Harry on that, but yeah, so we'll figure things out there.

But then I'm still trying to talk to Harry, because Harry was like, what do you want to get out of this PhD? Because he... We... Well, when I went to meet with him to talk about getting the letter, he was like, okay, cool.

And then I showed him, he was like, oh, interesting. Then he looked at me, and then he was like, you look very entrepreneurial, China. I read your application for your PhD. I was like, come here.

What do you want to get out of this? And then I was like, well, I think it's about creating new knowledge, and I think that it's great. But then, like, obviously, I still need to think it through a little bit more, and kind of flesh it out a little bit more with him as well. Okay.

That's good. If he's interested in you, that's good. Oh, really? Sure.

Yeah. So fingers crossed, we'll see. We'll see how it goes. He's got CTE, though.

He is CTE. Well, he never comes to meetings if he's CTE. I don't know what he is. He must have joint.

I think he's LSTD, and he just doesn't come to CTE meetings. That's probably why I like it. Yeah. Yeah.

Well, good. That's good. That's exciting. Yeah, I don't know.

We'll see. We'll talk. One step at a time. One step at a time.

But hang in there, and I love having you in class. I love your enthusiasm. Yeah. Thank you.

The craft project could be really cool. It's a great group. You're in a great group. Yeah, I think so, too.

So. I think they're, like, like, I know always, like, one thing that I learned from my experience is, like, I'm young, and, like, I can, like, try a bunch of random stuff, and I like trying random stuff, but, like, definitely benefit from their, like, lived experiences. Yeah. Yeah.

It's good. It's good. All right. I got to go.

All right. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. You're very, very welcome.

We'll be posted, and I'll see you next Thursday. I'll see you around. Thank you. Thank you.

You're welcome.`;
